  {"id":"amitYouSeeEnds2012","abstract":"We conducted three experiments indicating that characteristically deontological judgments—here, disapproving of sacrificing one person for the greater good of others—are preferentially supported by visual imagery. Experiment 1 used two matched working memory tasks—one visual, one verbal—to identify individuals with relatively visual cognitive styles and individuals with relatively verbal cognitive styles. Individuals with more visual cognitive styles made more deontological judgments. Experiment 2 showed that visual interference, relative to verbal interference and no interference, decreases deontological judgment. Experiment 3 indicated that these effects are due to people’s tendency to visualize the harmful means (sacrificing one person) more than the beneficial end (saving others). These results suggest a specific role for visual imagery in moral judgment: When people consider sacrificing someone as a means to an end, visual imagery preferentially supports the judgment that the ends do not justify the means. These results suggest an integration of the dual-process theory of moral judgment with construal-level theory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Amit","given":"Elinor"},{"family":"Greene","given":"Joshua D."}],"container-title":"Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Psychol Sci","DOI":"10.1177/0956797611434965","ISSN":"0956-7976","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"861-868","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"You See, the Ends Don’t Justify the Means: Visual Imagery and Moral Judgment","title-short":"You See, the Ends Don’t Justify the Means","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797611434965","volume":"23"},

While the correlation was clearly high, there was no evaluation of statistical significance; no such test was available at the time. This gap has now been filled by adapting to this aim a procedure based on the consistency index, and the level of significance is found to be much stronger than 10(-3). Possible reasons for coevolution of strictly genetic characters and the strictly cultural linguistic system are discussed briefly.

  {"id":"cavalli-sforzaGenesPeoplesLanguages1997","abstract":"The genetic history of a group of populations is usually analyzed by reconstructing a tree of their origins. Reliability of the reconstruction depends on the validity of the hypothesis that genetic differentiation of the populations is mostly due to population fissions followed by independent evolution. If necessary, adjustment for major population admixtures can be made. Dating the fissions requires comparisons with paleoanthropological and paleontological dates, which are few and uncertain. A method of absolute genetic dating recently introduced uses mutation rates as molecular clocks; it was applied to human evolution using microsatellites, which have a sufficiently high mutation rate. Results are comparable with those of other methods and agree with a recent expansion of modern humans from Africa. An alternative method of analysis, useful when there is adequate geographic coverage of regions, is the geographic study of frequencies of alleles or haplotypes. As in the case of trees, it is necessary to summarize data from many loci for conclusions to be acceptable. Results must be independent from the loci used. Multivariate analyses like principal components or multidimensional scaling reveal a number of hidden patterns and evaluate their relative importance. Most patterns found in the analysis of human living populations are likely to be consequences of demographic expansions, determined by technological developments affecting food availability, transportation, or military power. During such expansions, both genes and languages are spread to potentially vast areas. In principle, this tends to create a correlation between the respective evolutionary trees. The correlation is usually positive and often remarkably high. It can be decreased or hidden by phenomena of language replacement and also of gene replacement, usually partial, due to gene f low.","author":[{"family":"Cavalli-Sforza","given":"L Luca"}],"container-title":"Proc.

  {"id":"cavalli-sforzaReconstructionHumanEvolution1988","abstract":"The genetic information for this work came from a very large collection of gene frequencies for \"classical\" (non-DNA) polymorphisms of the world aborigines. The data were grouped in 42 populations studied for 120 alleles. The reconstruction of human evolutionary history thus generated was checked with statistical techniques such as \"bootstrapping.\" It changes some earlier conclusions and is in agreement with more recent ones, including published and unpublished DNA-marker results. The first split in the phylogenetic tree separates Africans from non-Africans, and the second separates two major clusters, one corresponding to Caucasoids, East Asians,'Arctic populations, and American natives, and the other to Southeast Asians (mainland and insular), Pacific islanders, and New Guineans and Australians. Average genetic distances between the most important clusters are proportional to archaeological separation times. Linguistic families correspond to groups of populations with very few, easily understood overlaps, and their origin can be given a time frame. Linguistic superfamilies show remarkable correspondence with the two major clusters, indicating considerable parallelism between genetic and linguistic evolution. The latest step in language development may have been an important factor determining' the rapid expansion that followed the appearance of modern humans and the demise of Neanderthals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Cavalli-Sforza","given":"L.

Matthews as 'absolutely clear, astonishingly complete, factually fascinating', The Languages of Australia (first published in 1980 and now reissued) was a landmark in Australian linguistics. This pioneering work of synthesis covered more than two hundred Aboriginal languages, and stimulated the next generation of scholarship in the field. The author's subsequent search for an overarching theoretical model to explain the unusual properties of Australian languages finally led him to adopt a 'punctuated equilibrium' model of language development. Dixon proposed this in The Rise and Fall of Languages (1997), which provided the framework for his major work Australian Languages: Their Nature and Development (2002)","author":[{"family":"Dixon","given":"R.

  {"id":"douvenAbduction2017","abstract":"In the philosophical literature, the term “abduction” isused in two related but different senses. In both senses, the termrefers to some form of explanatory reasoning. However, in thehistorically first sense, it refers to the place of explanatoryreasoning in generating hypotheses, while in the sense inwhich it is used most frequently in the modern literature it refers tothe place of explanatory reasoning in justifying hypotheses.In the latter sense, abduction is also often called “Inferenceto the Best Explanation.”, This entry is exclusively concerned with abduction in the modernsense, although there is a supplement on abduction in the historicalsense, which had its origin in the work of Charles SandersPeirce—see the, See also the entry on scientific discovery, in particular the section on discovery as abduction., Most philosophers agree that abduction (in the sense of Inference tothe Best Explanation) is a type of inference that is frequentlyemployed, in some form or other, both in everyday and in scientificreasoning. However, the exact form as well as the normative status ofabduction are still matters of controversy. This entry contrastsabduction with other types of inference; points at prominent uses ofit, both in and outside philosophy; considers various more or lessprecise statements of it; discusses its normative status; andhighlights possible connections between abduction and Bayesianconfirmation theory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Douven","given":"Igor"}],"container-title":"The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy","edition":"Summer 2017","editor":[{"family":"Zalta","given":"Edward N."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"publisher":"Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University","source":"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy","title":"Abduction","type":"chapter","URL":"https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/abduction/"},

  {"id":"graffiOriginLanguageOrigin2019","abstract":"Abstract\n            The question of monogenesis vs. polygenesis of human languages was essentially neglected by contemporary\n                    linguistics until the appearance of the research on the genetics of human populations by L. L. Cavalli-Sforza and his\n                    collaborators, which brought to light very exciting parallels between the distribution of human populations and that of language\n                    families. The present paper highlights some aspects of the history of the problem and some points of the contemporary discussion.\n                    We first outline the “Biblical paradigm”, which persisted until the 18th century even in scientific milieus. Then, we outline some\n                    aspects of the 19th century debate about monogenesis vs. polygenesis of languages and about the relationships between languages\n                    and human populations: in particular, we will discuss the views of Darwin on the one hand and of some linguists on the other\n                    (Schleicher, M. Müller, Whitney and Trombetti). It will be seen that their positions only partly coincide; at any rate, it will be\n                    shown that Darwin was partly inspired by the problems of the genealogy of languages and that the linguists, for their part, took\n                    account of Darwin’s views. Turning to today’s debate, we first present the positions of the linguists arguing for monogenesis,\n                    namely J. Greenberg and M. Ruhlen, as well as the criticisms raised against their methods by the majority of linguists. Other\n                    scholars, such as D. Bickerton or N. Chomsky, essentially argue, from different points of view, that the problem of monogenesis\n                    vs. polygenesis of languages is a “pseudo-problem”. We however think that, although the question cannot be reasonably solved by\n                    linguistic means, it cannot be discarded as meaningless: it is an anthropological rather than a linguistic problem. We present\n                    some reflections and suggestions, in the light of which the monogenetic hypothesis appears as more tenable than the polygenetic\n                    one.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Graffi","given":"Giorgio"}],"container-title":"Evolutionary Linguistic Theory","container-title-short":"ELT","DOI":"10.1075/elt.00002.gra","ISSN":"2589-1588, 2589-1596","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,24]]},"language":"en","page":"6-23","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Origin of language and origin of languages","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jbe-platform.com/content/journals/10.1075/elt.00002.gra","volume":"1"},

The only languages excluded are those belonging to the Na-Dene and Eskimo- Aleut families. It examines the now widely held view that Haida, the most distant language genetically, is not to be included in Na-Dene. It confined itself to Sapir's data, although the evidence could have been buttressed considerably by the use of more recent materials. What survives is a body of evidence superior to that which could be adduced under similar restrictions for the affinity of Albanian, Celtic, and Armenian, all three universally recognized as valid members of the Indo-European family of languages. A considerable number of historical hypotheses emerge from the present and the forthcoming volumes. Of these, the most fundamental bears on the question of the peopling of the Americas. If the results presented in this volume and in the companion volume on Eurasiatic are valid, the classification of the world's languages based on genetic criteria undergoes considerable simplification.","author":[{"family":"Greenberg","given":"Joseph H."}],"event-place":"Stanford, Calif","ISBN":"978-0-8047-1315-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[1987,6,30]]},"language":"Englisch","number-of-pages":"456","publisher":"Stanford University Press","publisher-place":"Stanford, Calif","source":"Amazon","title":"Language in the Americas","type":"book"},

Most pertinent work is currently based on expert cognate judgments. This limits the scope of this approach to a small number of well-studied language families. We used machine learning techniques to compile data suitable for phylogenetic inference from the ASJP database, a collection of almost 7,000 phonetically transcribed word lists over 40 concepts, covering two third of the extant world-wide linguistic diversity. First, we estimated Pointwise Mutual Information scores between sound classes using weighted sequence alignment and general-purpose optimization. From this we computed a dissimilarity matrix over all ASJP word lists. This matrix is suitable for distance-based phylogenetic inference. Second, we applied cognate clustering to the ASJP data, using supervised training of an SVM classifier on expert cognacy judgments. Third, we defined two types of binary characters, based on automatically inferred cognate classes and on sound-class occurrences. Several tests are reported demonstrating the suitability of these characters for character-based phylogenetic inference.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Jäger","given":"Gerhard"}],"container-title":"Scientific Data","container-title-short":"Sci Data","DOI":"10.1038/sdata.2018.189","ISSN":"2052-4463","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,12]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Global-scale phylogenetic linguistic inference from lexical resources","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06079","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"jagerPhylogeneticInferenceWord2013","abstract":"Abstract The paper investigates the task of inferring a phylogenetic tree of languages from the collection of word lists made available by the Automated Similarity Judgment Project. This task involves three steps: (1) computing pairwise word distances, (2) aggregating word distances to a distance measure between languages and inferring a phylogenetic tree from these distances, and (3) evaluating the result by comparing it to expert classiﬁcations. For the ﬁrst task, weighted alignment will be used and a method to determine weights empirically will be presented. For the second task a novel method will be developed that attempts to minimize the bias resulting from missing data. For the third task, several methods from the literature will be applied to a large collection of language samples to enable statistical testing. It will be shown that the language distance measure proposed here leads to substantially more accurate phylogenies than a method relying on unweighted Levenshtein distances between words.","author":[{"family":"Jäger","given":"Gerhard"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Phylogenetic inference from word lists using weighted alignment with empirically determined weights","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"lambSprungCommonSource1991","abstract":"With its range focused on Indo-European and extending across Eurasia and into the Americas, this collection of seventeen studies investigates various aspects of the long-range comparison and classification of Indo-European and other major language groups. Some of them confront the controversial question of whether Indo-European and certain other language families had, extending the celebrated phrase of Sir William Jones in 1786, 'sprung from some common source'. With comparative linguistics of recent decades in danger of stifling from an excess of caution, the quest for the answer to that question has now been broadened to attempt to find a deeper common source than Proto-Indo-European. This volume surveys the progress of the genetic classification of languages over the years, records recent developments, and points to abundant opportunities for future research. The contributors - some of the world's leading investigators of the genetic classification of languages - have adopted a broad outlook, looking beyond comparative Indo-European linguistics in two ways: first, by looking at genetic relationships outside of the Indo-European family, toward common sources more remote in time even than Proto-Indo-European, and, second, by looking beyond the grammar and phonology of Indo-European into the mythology, religion, and cultures of the early Indo-Europeans. The volume is in five parts. Part I contains a general introduction and a study of the work and influence of Sir William Jones. Part II discusses the languages and cultures of the Indo-Europeans and presents an archaeological insight into the peoples who preceded them. Part III presents a historical perspective on some problems of Indo-European and describes some recent work on various hypothesized relationships of Indo-European to other linguistic stocks, some of them far-reaching and controversial. Part IV surveys such potential cousins of Indo-European as Uralic, Altaic, and Kartvelian. P art V deals with methods of investigation, including a cautionary note to researchers who might exceed their evidence or be too hasty in positing distant genetic relationships, techniques that can be used to refine lexicostatistical studies, and a computer program for developing and testing hypotheses of distant relationships. The book is illustrated with 1 halftone, 34 line drawings, and 9 maps.<","editor":[{"family":"Lamb","given":"Professor Sydney M."},{"family":"Mitchell","given":"E.

When, why and where did our ancestors become linguistic animals, and what has happened since? This book provides a clear, comprehensive but lively introduction to these interdisciplinary debates. Written in an approachable style, it cuts through the complex, sometimes contradictory and often obscure technical languages used in the different scientific disciplines involved in the study of linguistic evolution. Assuming no background knowledge in these disciplines, the book outlines the physical and neurological structures underlying language systems, and the limits of our knowledge concerning their evolution. Discussion questions and further reading lists encourage students to explore the primary literature further, and the final chapter demonstrates that while many questions still remain unanswered, there is a growing consensus as to how modern human languages have arisen as systems by the interplay of evolved structures and cultural transmission\"--","author":[{"family":"McMahon","given":"April M.

In this chapter, the linguistic prehistories of four continents are surveyed with regard to linguistic spreads, linguistic diversity, and language family origins.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Nichols","given":"Johanna"}],"container-title":"Annual Review of Anthropology","DOI":"10.1146/annurev.anthro.26.1.359","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1997]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.anthro.26.1.359","page":"359-384","source":"Annual Reviews","title":"Modeling Ancient Population Structures and Movement in Linguistics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.anthro.26.1.359","volume":"26"},

It is a core topic of historical linguistics and is studied on all traditional linguistics degree courses.

There will also be discussion of the most prominent areas of research in the subject and readers will be able to review data selected from a wide range of languages to see how languages work and how differently they behave.","author":[{"family":"Song","given":"Jae Jung"}],"ISBN":"978-1-317-88343-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,9,15]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"427","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Google Books","title":"Linguistic Typology: Morphology and Syntax","title-short":"Linguistic Typology","type":"book"},

  {"id":"swadeshOriginDiversificationLanguage2017","abstract":"Morris Swadesh, one of this century's foremost scientific investigators of language, dedicated much of his life to the study of the origin and evolution of language. This volume, left nearly completed at his death and edited posthumously by Joel F. Sherzer, is his last major study of this difficult subject.Swadesh discusses the simple qualities of human speech also present in animal language, and establishes distinctively human techniques of expression by comparing the common features that are found in modern and ancient languages. He treats the diversification of language not only by isolating root words in different languages, but also by dealing with sound systems, with forms of composition, and with sentence structure. In so doing, he demonstrates the evidence for the expansion of all language from a single central area. Swadesh supports his hypothesis by \"exhibits\" that conveniently present the evidence in tabular form. Further clarity is provided by the use of a suggestive practical phonetic system, intelligible to the student as well as to the professional.The book also contains an Appendix, in which the distinguished ethnographer of language, Dell Hymes, gives a valuable account of the prewar linguistic tradition within which Swadesh did some of his most important work.","author":[{"family":"Swadesh","given":"Morris"}],"edition":"1.

  {"id":"talbottBayesianEpistemology2016","abstract":"‘Bayesian epistemology’ became an epistemological movementin the 20th century, though its two main features can betraced back to the eponymous Reverend Thomas Bayes (c. 1701–61). Thosetwo features are: (1) the introduction of a formal apparatusfor inductive logic; (2) the introduction of a pragmaticself-defeat test (as illustrated by Dutch Book Arguments) forepistemic rationality as a way of extending the justificationof the laws of deductive logic to include a justification for the lawsof inductive logic. The formal apparatus itself has two main elements:the use of the laws of probability as coherence constraints onrational degrees of belief (or degrees of confidence) and theintroduction of a rule of probabilistic inference, a rule or principleof conditionalization., Bayesian epistemology did not emerge as a philosophical programuntil the first formal axiomatizations of probability theory in thefirst half of the 20th century. One importantapplication of Bayesian epistemology has been to the analysis ofscientific practice in Bayesian Confirmation Theory. Inaddition, a major branch of statistics, Bayesianstatistics, is based on Bayesian principles. In psychology,an important branch of learning theory, Bayesian learningtheory, is also based on Bayesian principles. Finally, theidea of analyzing rational degrees of belief in terms of rationalbetting behavior led to the 20th century development of anew kind of decision theory, Bayesian decision theory, which isnow the dominant theoretical model for both the descriptive andnormative analysis of decisions. The combination of its preciseformal apparatus and its novel pragmatic self-defeat test forjustification makes Bayesian epistemology one of the most importantdevelopments in epistemology in the 20th century, and one ofthe most promising avenues for further progress in epistemology in the21st century.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Talbott","given":"William"}],"container-title":"The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy","edition":"Winter 2016","editor":[{"family":"Zalta","given":"Edward N."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"publisher":"Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University","source":"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy","title":"Bayesian Epistemology","type":"chapter","URL":"https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/epistemology-bayesian/"},

  {"id":"vogelInferenceBestExplanation2016","abstract":"Inference to the best explanation is the procedure of choosing the hypothesis or theory that best explains the available data. The factors that make one explanation better than another may include depth, comprehensiveness, simplicity and unifying power. According to Harman (1965), explanatory inference plays a central role in both everyday and scientific thinking. In ordinary life, a person might make the inference that a fuse has blown to explain why several kitchen appliances stopped working all at once. Scientists also seem to engage in inference to the best explanation; for example, astronomers concluded that another planet must exist in order to account for aberrations in the orbit of Uranus. However, despite the suggestiveness of cases like these, the extent to which we do and should rely on inference to the best explanation is highly controversial.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Vogel","given":"Jonathan"}],"container-title":"Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy","DOI":"10.4324/9780415249126-P025-1","edition":"1","event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-0-415-25069-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"publisher":"Routledge","publisher-place":"London","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Inference to the best explanation","type":"chapter","URL":"https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/thematic/inference-to-the-best-explanation/v-1"},

  {"id":"zhangHowManyEnough2016","abstract":"Lexicostatistics has been applied in linguistics to inform phylogenetic relations among languages. There are two important yet not well-studied parameters in this approach: the conventional size of vocabulary list to collect potentially true cognates and the minimum matching instances required to conﬁrm a recurrent sound correspondence. Here, we derive two statistical principles from stochastic theorems to quantify these parameters. These principles validate the practice of using the Swadesh 100- and 200-word lists to indicate degree of relatedness between languages, and enable a frequency-based, dynamic threshold to detect recurrent sound correspondences. Using statistical tests, we further evaluate the generality of the Swadesh 100-word list compared to the Swadesh 200-word list and other 100-word lists sampled randomly from the Swadesh 200-word list. All these provide mathematical support for applying lexicostatistics in historical and comparative linguistics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Menghan"},{"family":"Gong","given":"Tao"}],"container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front.
